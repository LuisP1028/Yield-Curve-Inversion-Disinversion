Create a .bat file and include paths to your 
python.exe directory (to run this headless)
and the path to the directory where you saved 
the script. 

It should look like this: 

"C:\Path\To\anaconda3\pythonw.exe" "C:\Path\To\Script\Directory\yieldcurves.py"

Then, set up a task scheduler.
Boom.
